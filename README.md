# AvatarFusion
Official implementation of ACM Multimedia 2023 paper: 

**AvatarFusion: 
Zero-shot Generation of Clothing-Decoupled 3D Avatars Using 2D Diffusion**
(<a href="https://hansenhuang0823.github.io/AvatarFusion/"> project page </a>)

## To-Do List:
- [ ] open source inference code by Sept. 17th.
- [ ] open source checkpoints of avatars in standing pose by Sept. 28th.
- [âœ”] open source the training code.
- [ ] open source benchmark FC-50.

## Training

We offer three PSDS schedules, with the default schedule being the most stable one. Since the level of understanding of Stable Diffusion varies among individual characters, if clothing decoupling cannot be achieved, you can switch the schedules by adding "--schedule 1 (or 2)" or modifying the text prompts in the configurations.

    python avatarfusion.py --mode train_diffusion --conf confs/TomCruise_opensource.conf
Low VRAM users can reduce resolution ("max_ray_num") in line 66, avatarfusion.py.
